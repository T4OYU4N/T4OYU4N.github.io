Welcome! I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Systems Engineering & Engineering Management](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/) supervised by [Prof. Huifu Xu](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~hfxu/). Previously, I obtained my Master degree in Management Science and Engineering (2020-2023) at [Nanjing University](https://sme.nju.edu.cn/englishversion/main.htm) supervised by Prof. Caihua Chen, and a bachelor's degree in Statistics (2016-2020) at [Nanjing University](https://math.nju.edu.cn/en/index.html).

My research interest lies in operations research, including game theory and data-driven optimization.
