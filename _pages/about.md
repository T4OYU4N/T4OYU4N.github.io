Welcome! I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Systems Engineering & Engineering Management](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/) supervised by [Prof. Huifu Xu](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~hfxu/). Previously, I received a master's degree in [Management Science & Engineering](https://sme.nju.edu.cn/englishversion/main.htm) and a bachelor's degree in [Statistics](https://math.nju.edu.cn/en/index.html) from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) supervised by [Prof. Caihua Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I6ewvyIAAAAJ) in 2023 and 2020 respectively.

My research interest lies in operations research, including stochastic optimization and game theory.
